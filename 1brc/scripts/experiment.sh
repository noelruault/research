# One autoresearch experiment: N arms of the same binary, correctness-gated, timed in ONE hyperfine invocation, written to a dated file under 1brc/bench/ with a pre-filled ledger row.
# One invocation is necessary and not sufficient (E-16, CORRECTIONS.md C6): without the cooldown below, eight IDENTICAL arms rank monotonically over 21%, so an arm's slot decides its verdict.
# The rules it refuses to let you break are in 07-experiment-ledger.md's header.

usage: experiment.sh -i <hypothesis-id> -p <prediction> -a <name>=<flags> -a <name>=<flags> [...]
                     [-f 1b|100m|10m|10k-stations-10m] [-r runs] [-w warmup] [--mechanism-only]

  -i  hypothesis id, e.g. H-14 or "queue item 6". Names the row this run will fill.
  -p  the prediction, made BEFORE the run, and it must contain a number.
      A sweep with no hypothesis is allowed only as -p 'sweep: <why>', which labels the row honestly.
  -a  one arm, name=flags. At least two: a delta needs something to be a delta from.
      The first arm should be the incumbent, because a percentage is relative to the arm being replaced.
  -f  measurement file, default 1b. Anything else needs --mechanism-only (E-09).
  -c  cooldown seconds slept before every timed run, default 20 at 1b and 0 elsewhere.
      E-16: without it, eight IDENTICAL arms rise monotonically by 21% and the arm named
      first wins whatever it is. 0 is allowed and stamps the file NOT SLOT-CORRECTED.

  --self-test  run the argument and invariant checks and exit; touches no data file.

example:
  experiment.sh -i 'queue item 6' -p 'oversubscription hides read stalls, 3-8%' \
    -a 'workers15=-workers 15' -a 'workers20=-workers 20' -a 'workers30=-workers 30'
